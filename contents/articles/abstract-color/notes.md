One of the most distinctive features one sees on the canvas of Woman II are the long brown drips that fall from the figure's chest. These are the result of de Kooning having put a heavily solvent-laden mixture into this area and simply letting it drip down through the underlying paint layers. The solvent that he almost certainly would have been using at that time would have been a very common one in a painter's studio: the use of turpentine. This material has discolored and browned somewhat over the years. It almost certainly did not look as brown in the 1950s as it does today.
