Arguably the highpoint of American Art in the 20th century, Abstract Expressionism represented an undeniable paradigm shift in the way the Western art world made and thought about art.

Rooted in Modernism and popularized by the famous Jackson Pollock In the 1940's, Abstract Expressionism was a new approach to studio art. All at once innovative, phallic, and raw, Ab-Ex generally presented little or no figurative elements, many times relying strictly on the "Painterly Gesture" of the artist.

The impact of Abstract Expressionism goes far deeper than studio art. One of the major contributions of the Abstract Expressionists was their bold and commanding use of color. When I'm stuck choosing colors for a project, I often reference works from this time. Because artists of this movement focused purely on form and process rather than figurative content, their use of color is often very bold and communicative. Below are some of my favorite artists from this period.

## Willem de Kooning

Willem de Kooning took color to another level. He worked with paint very loosely, and tried to keep the paint wet as long as possible. To that end he endlessly experimented with paint, adding cooking oils, turpentine drips, and endless amounts of medium and thinner. He also created very ellaborate color charts which outlined and organized colors by their dry time.

>"Style is a fraud. I always felt the Greeks were hiding behind their columns."

This obsession with color shows in his work. He often uses warmer, more earthy colors such as ochre, yellow, burnt sienna, and cream, but wasn't afraid of cool colors, or even pastels.

Many times the color in his pieces has a life all its own, not relying on composition at all. Even though much of his work is moderately figurative, his use of color bring an expressive and bold voice to his work.

## Adolph Gottlieb

Adolph Gottlieb was an American painter who studied in New York but did most of his work in the Arizona desert. The sense of space in his paintings clearly reflects the emmense environment that surrounded him day to day. The vast space he created in his "landscapes" often becomes purely abstract, reduced to its most basic form and color. He is considered one of the first color-field painters.

Gottlieb was a commanding colorist, even though his pallettes often include very few colors. Color was especially important in his *Burst* series during the early seventies and this period in his career is a terrific cache of commanding and graphic palletes.

Perhaps the best known of the abstract expressionist movement, Jackson Pollock is a commanding character in art history.
