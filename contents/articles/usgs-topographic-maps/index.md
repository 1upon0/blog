The USGS took over responsibility for mapping the country in 1879 and has been the primary civilian mapping agency of the United States ever since. The best known USGS maps are the 1:24,000-scale topographic maps, also known as 7.5-minute quadrangles. More than 55,000 7.5-minute maps were made to cover the 48 conterminous States. This is the only uniform map series that covers the entire area of the United States in considerable detail.

The 7.5-minute map series was officially completed in 1992, and the program has recently been replaced by The National Map All topographic maps from the 7.5-minute program, as well as various derived products, remain available for sale.

## Modern USGS Maps

US Topo quadrangles are digital topographic maps produced by the National Geospatial Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Created in the familiar 7.5-minute quadrangle format like the legacy paper maps, US Topo maps support frequent updating, wide and fast public distribution, and basic, on-screen geographic analysis.

US Topo maps are available for free Web download from the USGS Store. Each map is delivered in PDF format with geospatial extensions (GeoPDFÂ®) and is made from key layers of geographic data - orthoimagery, transportation, geographic names, topographic contours, boundaries, hydrography, structures, and woodlands - found in The National Map. The National Map is a nationwide repository of integrated data from local, State, Federal, and other sources. Recent US Topo maps also include the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and the United States National Grid (USNG).

Users can turn US Topo data layers on and off as needed, zoom in and out to examine specific features or see a broader area, and print the maps in their entirety or in customized sections on a broad array of printing devices. Viewing and analytical tools are available for free download from Adobe and TerraGo Technologies. File size for each US Topo is about 15-20 megabytes.

US Topo maps are produced by the USGS National Geospatial Technical Operations Center. The first US Topo prototypes, "Digital Maps - Beta," were made in June 2009. A limited number of these maps were made spanning 18 states. As of October 2012, the prototype maps were replaced by US Topo maps and the "Digital Maps - Beta" prototype maps are no longer available. More information about US Topo maps can be found here.

The USGS also distributes digital versions of earlier US Topo and paper topographic quadrangle maps through the Historical Topographic Map Collection. These maps also are available for download through the USGS Store.
